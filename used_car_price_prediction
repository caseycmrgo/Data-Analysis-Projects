/*
An exploration of used car price prediction
Dataset found on Kaggle follow link here -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayaz11/used-car-price-prediction

Skills used: Importing existing data, Altering tables, Aggregate functions, CTE's 

For this exploration I really wanted to get a good picure of what the average pricess were for cars based on make, the number of miles, and year. 

This data set was visualized in Tableau here ---> https://public.tableau.com/views/UsedCarsPricePrediction/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

--created a new table to reorder the columns in a meaningful way

---I am planning on buying a car in the future.I want to use this table to understand what cars are within my budget and what cars I would perfer are going for. 
I can also use this table to help me get an idea of what I can sell my car for. 



UPDATE predictions.used_car_prices_v2
SET miles = REGEXP_REPLACE(miles, '[^0-9]', '')
WHERE miles IS NOT NULL;

--After bringing up the table I realized that the miles column contained the word miles next to each number. This is redundant and unnecessary. This code eliminated the word miles in the column. 


select * from predictions.used_car_prices_v2
order by price desc

-- After the last run of the table I was wondering if there were any outliers that I really did not need. There are three luxury brands that do not fit into the use of this table

DELETE FROM  `my-data-project-12345-391422.predictions.used_car_prices_v2`
WHERE make LIKE '%Rolls-Royce%';
--This code was used to remove the outliers for all three. 


select * from predictions.used_car_prices_v2
order by price desc

--used this code to check that my previous code did what I needed for it to do

--I created a third version of this table to keep things organized for myself.
