--Code to pull up the table that I will use to answer these questions.



ALTER TABLE `sqlprojects-401615.game_sales.best_sellers`
RENAME COLUMN Sales TO Sales_in_Millions 

--It was not clear what the sales were being measured in. This column name changed helped clarify that the numbers were in millions.



SELECT  sum(Sales_in_Millions) as Sum_of_Sales, Genre 
FROM `sqlprojects-401615.game_sales.best_sellers` 
GROUP BY Genre
ORDER BY Sum_of_Sales DESC

- selected the highest sum of sales per genre to find which genre was most popular. Action role-playing games as a genre generated the most sales 



SELECT count(name) as  Number_Of_Games, publisher
FROM `sqlprojects-401615.game_sales.best_sellers` 
GROUP BY Publisher

SELECT  sum(Sales_in_Millions) as Sum_of_Sales, publisher 
FROM `sqlprojects-401615.game_sales.best_sellers` 
GROUP BY Publisher
